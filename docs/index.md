## Pinball!

This post goes into details of how a (mini) pinball game was conceptualized, designed and prototyped. It is not the size of a regular pinball table but is rather a tabletop pinball game. The game utilizes multiple sensors, motors and is interactive. Game stats are communicated via an LCD screen and speaker. The whole game is driven by a single Arduino Mega 2560 R3. I had created this for my 11 year son and luckily it became hugely popular among his friends (and also some grown-ups!).

Conceptualization:

The game idea primarily came into existence after we were thinking of building a more complex project together. I personally find pinball addictive and the gameplay is exciting. Right from the outset we decided that it will not be the normal size table due to storage space and budget constraints. We need something that could be dismantled and packed up for storage, taking minimal space. Our first concept was simply on a whiteboard mostly designed by my son with some help. Here it is:
